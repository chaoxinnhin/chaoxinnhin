### Hello there! I'm Chao Xin Nhin (Chao Sheen Nhin) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

I have been honing my web application development skills since the beginning of this year through the Mission Ready program. My expertise includes working with various coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Scss, Javascript, React js, and Node js. Moreover, I am adept at constructing databases using MySQL and Mongo DB. I also have experience building containers using Docker and deploying them on Google Cloud Platform. 

Currently, I am focusing on learning Object Oriented Programming to improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Additionally, I am dedicating my efforts to developing my knowledge of various cloud platforms, in order to better understand the significance of their different services and how they can be utilized in various projects.

If you would like to have my help with your team, feel free to contact me. ![SoExcited~GIF](https://github.com/chaoxinnhin/chaoxinnhin/assets/122791168/5c19ca12-6220-46da-bd49-c72d24ba03b8)
